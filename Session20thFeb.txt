Directives :-

these are angular keywords which can be used for different purposes. These all are used in  Html Pages only. 

these are starts with "ngDirectiveName"

ngModel
ngIf
ngClass

ngIf-else 

<tag *ngIf="condition; then template1;else template2">

How to create a class?
	ng g class <classname>
	ng g class employee
	ng g component employee


to add value to an array push() method can use
	arrayname.push(value)

to remove a value from an array 
	arrayname.splice(indexval, no of values)
-------------------
Forms & Validations:- 
As per angular, there are two types of forms 

1. Template Driven Forms
2. Reactive Driven Forms

Template Driven Forms :- 
these  forms normal form regularly creating using html, for that form by using anuglar we can apply validations. 

this type of forms are useful whenever creating simple forms like Login, Feedback, Contact .....

to create any type of forms first we have import "FormsModule". 

------------------------
Reactive Driven Forms :- 

These forms are newly added forms into angular. 
Here form creation will be done in typescript file later html control created. 

1.  Import a Module called as "ReactiveFormsModule"
2.  To represent each field  user following classes 
		FormControl, FormGroup, FormBuild classes are used to hold group of controls. 
3.  To specify validations, use "Validators" class

For Validation purpose for Both Template & Reactive Driven Forms:-

touched 
	true  :  field focused
	false :  field not focused

untouched
	true  :  field not focused
	false :  field  focused

pristine 
	true  :  field not modified by the user
	false :  field modified  by the user

valid 
	true :  field value is valid
	false:  field value not valid

invalid 
	true :  field value not valid
	false:  field value  valid

^[0-9]*$ = Only Numbers
^[a-zA-Z]*$ = only alphabets
