------------------
What is an TypeScript?
	It is a programming language which has been developed using JavaScript.

		JavaScript + Additional Features =  TypeScript
			1.  Data Types are existed in TypeScript to declare variables
				a. number = for integer and float
				b. string =  for string values
				c. boolean =  for boolean(true/false)
				d. any 	   =  for any data type
			2.   Arrow Functions
			3.   It provides a compiler, so that to work with typescript
				we have to install typescript software. 
 			4.   Intellisence :-  
				it will provide all the methods when we go with dot operator.
			5.  OOPS Concepts
				Object, Class, Inheritance, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation

Why TypeScript :-  To Simplify  JavaScript Code(with persepction of OOPS).

Steps to Install TypeScript?

1.  Download and Install Node JS?
2.  Install TypeScript with following command. 

What is an NPM?
It is a Node Package Manager, it is world largest software library for the following languages
			TypeScript
			Angular(typescript)
			React JS
			Node JS
			Vue JS
			Express JS
It has over millions of library files. To work with any lang in the list we need NPM. 
Npm comes with Node JS. i.e. Once we install Node JS, it provides NPM. It is a freeware. 

By going to http://nodejs.org, download and install NodeJS. 
Once it is done, we can the software by checking it's versions at command prompts. 

	C:\>node -v  :- shows node js Version
	C:\>npm -v :- shows npm version
What is an CLI?
	Command Line Client, which provides set of commands to perform different actions. 

How to install TypeScript?
	1. Goto Command Prompt?
	2. Use following command
		npm install typescript -g

Once typescript is intalled, check with following command
	C:\>tsc  -v

Steps to write TypeScript Program:- 
1.  Open any text editor(VSCode).
2.  Code the program as per the requirement.
3.  Save the program with .ts extension
4.  Go to command prompt, use following commands to compile and execute
	for Compile :-
			C:\>tsc  filename.ts
	Once compilation is done, it will generate .js file for an execution
	for Run :-
			C:\>node filename.js
----------------------
How to Declare Variables in TypeScript?
	var <variablename> : <data type> = <value>;
----------------------
OOPS Concepts:- 
	OOPS :-  Object Oriented Programming Structure
		It is a methodology to develop any applications in a secured way. OOPS provides data security.
			Object
			Class
			Abstraction
			Encapsulation
			Inheritance
			Polymarphisum
--------------------------
What is an Object?
		It is a thing in the real world. 
				any object has two parts
				1. Attributes
				2. Functionalities

		Ex:-  Car is an Object
			Attributes:-  Model, Company, Color, Capacity, .....
			Functionality :-  Changing Gears, use breaks for Stop, .....

		Mobile is an Object
			Attributes:-  Model, Company, Memory Capacity, size, .....
			Functionality :-  Making Calls, Surfing Internet, Taking Photos and Videos, Storing data, ..

Class :- It is an encapsulated cell, which meant for defining attributes and functionalities of an object. 

how to create a class:-

class <classname>
{
	variable:data type=value  //attributes
	.....
	.....

	methodname([parameters]):<return type> // functionalities
	{
		body of the method
	}

	......
}

Object Creation:- 
	var ObjectName = new ClassName([parameter values])
with the help of object, the class members are accessed.
	Object.Variable/methodname()

"this" keyword:-  here inside the class, it is used to access class variables.
------------------------
What is a constructor? 
	it is a special method of the class which can be executed whenever object is created for that class.
	purpose of the constructor, is to initialize instance varaibles at the time of object creation.

how to create constructor?
		as per typescript, constructor is created with "constructor" keyword. 
		constructor([para meters])
		{
			body of the constructor
		}
----------------------
Access Specifiers:- 
private, public, protected
-------------------------
As per the inheritance,  to inherit a parent class to child class "extends" keyword is used. 
class childclassname extends parentclassname
{
	....
}
------------------
What is an Angular?
It is a client side framework, which is used to create web applications. 
It provides a skeleton of the project whenever we create application.

It follows a structure called SPA(Single Page Application).
It works with TypeScript.
It is a open-source, so that we can use freely with NPM and Client Side CLI. 

It can be used in combination  with any server side platform such as Java, Asp.net, Php, pYthon, etc
It is a cross-platform i.e.  it works on any operating system.

JavaScript
jQuery (Modified version of JS)
Angular JS (Single Page Application)
Angular  (Modified version of Angular JS)

We have different versions of Angular 2.0 ..... 10, 11,...
latest version of Angular 20.0

How to install Angular :- 

1.  Install NPM(comes with Node JS)
2.  Install TypeScript
	npm install typescript -g
3.  Install Angular with following command
	npm install @angular/cli -g   // it always install latest version of Angular. 

	npm install -g angular-cli@16.2.0  // it is meant for specific version
	npm install -g @angular/cli@18.0
How to uninstall existing angular  then install specific version of angular
	npm uninstall -g angular-cli
	npm cache clean
	npm install -g angular-cli@16.2.0
-----------------------------
How to create an angular application?
	Goto Command Prompt, then use following command
		ng new <application name>

How to run an Angular Application
	1.  goto command prompt and enter into application folder by follwoing command
		cd  ApplicationFolderName

	2.  Use below given command
		ng serve

Once application is started, then it works with a port number 4200.
	so that use follwing url on browser to get output
		http://localhost:4200/

Note :-  To stop application execution 
		"Ctrl + C" has to used
-----------------------------------
What is an Component?
A  Component is a unit of angular where it consist a set of files for different purposes.
Angular having collection of components. A component is a combination different files as follows
		An Html Page for Structure(Desinging) - (.html)
		An CSS Page for Styling - (.css)
		An TypeScript page for Script code - (.ts)
		An Testing page for Test the code - (.spec.ts)

By default every angular app having a companent called "App". "App" Component is a root component.

use following command to create a component
		ng g component <component name>

once we create component, that has to be render into app component as follows
1. Import component in app.component.ts file
@Component({
	.....
  imports: [RouterOutlet, HomeComponent],
	....
})
2. goto app.component.html then use selector as follows
<app-home></app-home>
------------------
Data Bindings:-

it is a relation b/w typescript  and html page. It is mainly used for data bindings of variables declared as well as methods defined in "ts" files.

it can be done in 4 ways

1.  Interpolation Bindings
2.  Property Binding
3.  Event Binding
4.  Two - Way Binding

1. Interpolation :- 
		It is the process of showing typescript variable value in html page. 
			use below given syntax in html page
				{{variable name}}
			As per typescript, the data types are 
				string, number(integer & float), boolean(true/false), any
				and variables can be declared as follows
					var_name:data type = "initial value"

2. Property Binding :- 
		It is the process of binding a value to the specific attribute of the html tag. 
		<tag  [attributename] = "variable" /></tag>

	<a href="pagename" ... />  here "href" is a property

	<img src="file name"  width="..."  height="..." alt="..." />  
				here   "src, width, height, alt, ...." are the properties
 
3. Event Binding :-  It is the process of adding events to the html elements
		<tag  (eventname) = "method name" />

4. Two way Binding :- 
It is the process of binding a variable to any element and it is having reflection b/w variable and an element. i.e.  if we change value in element, that automatically reflected in variable and vice versa. 
			here we have to use "ngModel" directive for the html tag. 

			<tag  [(ngModel)] = "variable" />

		here we have to import a package in .ts  file  "FormsModule" in Import Section

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
 imports: [
   ....
    FormsModule
  ],
-----------------------
Routing :-  It is the concept of navigating pages/components within the web application. 

Steps

1.  import @angular/router package

2.  Create Routes(set of links for components)  in app.routes.ts file
	
	export const routes: Routes = [
	{path:"Link Text", component:ComponentName},
	{path:"Link Text", component:ComponentName},
	{path:"Link Text", component:ComponentName},
	.............
	];

3. Add these routes into app.config.ts as follows
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }), provideRouter(routes)]
};

4. Goto app.component.ts then import RouterOutlet class in import section as follows
imports: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink, ....],

5. Now create a hyperlink for every route as follows  in  app.component.html
	<a routerLink="Link Text">Link</a>

6. Create a placeholder to display route/page content in app.component.html
	<router-outlet> </router-outlet>
-------------
Router :-  this class object is used to navigate component dynamically based on events. 

Steps
1.  Import Router Class from @angular/router
2.  Create an object Router Class as a constructor parameter. 
3.  with that object, we can navigate page as follows
		this.routerObject.navigate(['/linktext']);
-----------------------
Directives :-

these are angular keywords which can be used for different purposes. These all are used in  Html Pages only. 

these are starts with "ngDirectiveName"

ngModel
ngClass
ngFor
ngIf
ngSwitch
--------------------
ngClass :-  it is used to assign css classes as variable to the html elements.

ngIf :-  It is used to check condition in html page. 

	<tag  *ngIf="Condition">
		content
	</tag>

ngIf-else 

<tag *ngIf="condition; then template1;else template2">
</tag>

here template1 and template2 are the containers where some info has to defined. it has to done with 
ng-template tag. 

<ng-template #templatename>
	content
</ng-template>
-------------------
ngFor :-  it is meant for looping process. 

<tag  *ngFor="let var of arrayVariable">
</tag>
---------------------
ngSwitch :- 

<tag  [ngSwitch]="variable">
	<tag *ngSwitchCase=" 'value-1' "/>
	<tag *ngSwitchCase=" 'value-2' "/>
	....
	<tag *ngSwitchCase=" 'value-n' "/>
	<tag *ngSwitchDefault/>
</tag>

How to create a class?
	ng g class <classname>

to add value to an array push() method can use
	arrayname.push(value)

to remove a value from an array 
	arrayname.splice(indexval, no of values)
